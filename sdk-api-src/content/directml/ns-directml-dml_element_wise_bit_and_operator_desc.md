## -description

Computes the bitwise AND between each corresponding element of the input tensors, and writes the result into the output tensor.

The input and output tensor must have the same *DimensionCount*, *Sizes*, and *DataType*.

This operator supports in-place execution, meaning that the output tensor is permitted to alias one or more of the input tensors during binding.

## -struct-fields

### -field ATensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the left-hand side inputs.

### -field BTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

A tensor containing the right-hand side inputs.

### -field OutputTensor

Type: **const [DML_TENSOR_DESC](/windows/win32/api/directml/ns-directml-dml_tensor_desc)\***

The output tensor to write the results to.

## Availability
This operator was introduced in `DML_FEATURE_LEVEL_3_0`.

## Tensor constraints
*ATensor*, *BTensor*, and *OutputTensor* must have the same *DataType*, *DimensionCount*, and *Sizes*.

## Tensor support
| Tensor | Kind | Supported dimension counts | Supported data types |
| ------ | ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| ATensor | Input | 1 to 8 | UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
| BTensor | Input | 1 to 8 | UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
| OutputTensor | Output | 1 to 8 | UINT32, UINT16, UINT8 |
